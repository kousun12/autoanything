# AutoAnything

![teaser](progress.png)

**AutoAnything** is a framework where you define what to optimize and how to score it, then unleash a swarm of agents to hill-climb relentlessly. You come back to a leaderboard of experiments and a measurably better system.

The concept: any optimization problem with a black-box scoring function. Agents propose changes by pushing git branches. A private evaluator scores them serially and merges improvements. Agents never see the scoring code — just the leaderboard.

Think of it as **Kaggle for code**: the leaderboard is public, the test set is private, and submissions are git branches.

Currently configured for the GPT pretraining use case (optimizing val_bpb), based on [karpathy/nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat). Originally forked from [karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch).

## How it works

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│       Challenge Repo         │     Agents clone this, push branches or open PRs
│                              │
│  problem.yaml                │     What to optimize, constraints
│  state/train.py              │     The mutable file agents edit
│  context/prepare.py          │     Read-only context
│  agent_instructions.md       │     Protocol for agents
│  leaderboard.md              │     Auto-updated scoreboard
│  NO scoring code             │
└──────────┬───────────────────┘
           │
   push branches / open PRs
           │
    ┌──────┴──────┐
    │  Evaluator   │     Private, gitignored, serial
    │              │
    │  score.sh    │     Runs scoring function
    │  evaluate.py │     Poll → score → merge/discard
    │  server.py   │     Webhook → score → comment/merge/close
    │  history.db  │     SQLite evaluation history
    └──────────────┘
```

**Agents** clone the repo, read the problem definition and leaderboard, modify the mutable files, and push a branch (`proposals/<name>/<description>`) or open a PR. They never see the scoring code.

**The evaluator** watches for new branches or PRs, scores them one at a time (serial queue), and either merges to master (if improved) or discards/closes. The scoring code, test data, and history DB are all private (gitignored).

## Quick start

**Requirements:** A single NVIDIA GPU (tested on H100), Python 3.10+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
uv sync

# 2. Download data and train tokenizer (one-time, ~2 min)
uv run context/prepare.py

# 3. Run a single training experiment (~5 min)
uv run state/train.py
```

## Setting up the evaluator

The evaluator is private and runs on your scoring machine. It's gitignored — agents never see it. Two deployment options:

### Option A: Polling evaluator (watches for proposal branches)

```bash
# 1. Establish baseline (runs training once, records the score)
python evaluator/evaluate.py --baseline-only

# 2. Start the evaluation loop (polls for proposal branches)
python evaluator/evaluate.py

# 3. With auto-push (pushes leaderboard updates to origin)
python evaluator/evaluate.py --push
```

### Option B: Web evaluator (receives GitHub PR webhooks)

```bash
# 1. Establish baseline first (same as above)
python evaluator/evaluate.py --baseline-only

# 2. Start the webhook server
python evaluator/server.py --push

# 3. Configure the GitHub webhook:
#    URL: https://<your-domain>/webhook
#    Content type: application/json
#    Secret: (set matching WEBHOOK_SECRET env var on the server)
#    Events: Pull requests only
```

The web evaluator listens for PR webhooks, scores submissions serially, comments results on the PR, and merges (if improved) or closes (if not). Agents open PRs instead of pushing branches. Set `WEBHOOK_SECRET` for signature verification.

## Running agents

Point any AI agent at this repo. They should read `agent_instructions.md` for the protocol:

```
Read agent_instructions.md and start optimizing. Check the leaderboard first.
```

Agents create branches like `proposals/agent-1/higher-lr` and push them, or open PRs targeting master. The evaluator picks them up automatically.

## Project structure

```
problem.yaml              — problem definition (what to optimize, constraints)
agent_instructions.md     — protocol for agents
leaderboard.md            — auto-updated scoreboard
state/train.py            — mutable file (agents edit this)
context/prepare.py        — read-only context (constants, data, evaluation)
evaluator/                — GITIGNORED (private scoring)
  score.sh                — runs training, extracts metrics
  evaluate.py             — serial evaluation loop (polls for branches)
  server.py               — webhook-driven web evaluator (scores PRs)
  history.db              — SQLite history (created on first run)
```

## Design

- **Serial evaluation.** One proposal scored at a time. No race conditions, no stale comparisons. The incumbent never changes during an evaluation.
- **Blind scoring.** Agents can't see the evaluator. If they could, they'd game it. Same reason Kaggle keeps the test set private.
- **Git as the protocol.** Branches and PRs track proposals, master tracks the best state. Anything that can `git push` or open a PR can be an agent.
- **Fixed time budget.** Training runs for exactly 5 minutes. This makes experiments comparable regardless of what the agent changes.
- **Discard is forever.** If a proposal doesn't improve the score, it's gone. Agents can read the history and try refined versions, but there's no "almost" list.

## What you could optimize

The current problem is ML training (val_bpb), but AutoAnything generalizes to any black-box optimization:

- A prompt template (scored by LLM-as-judge accuracy)
- A web app's Lighthouse performance score
- A compiler optimization pass (scored by benchmark runtime)
- A trading strategy (scored by backtested Sharpe ratio)
- A game AI (scored by win rate against a baseline)

The common pattern: mutable state, a scoring function, and a direction (minimize or maximize).

## Heritage

Originally [karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) — single-agent, serial, one machine. AutoAnything is the distributed, multi-agent generalization.
